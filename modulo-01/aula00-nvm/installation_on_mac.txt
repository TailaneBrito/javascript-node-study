open your terminal (hotkey Command + Space)

1. You need to uninstall node and its dependencies

Run `brew uninstall --ignore-dependencies node`
and `bew uninstall --force node`

2. Update Brew and Install NVM 
In your terminal run `brew update`

your brew terminal can be stuck with some errors: 
1. fatal couldn't find remore ref refs/heads/master
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/75509911/fatal-couldnt-find-remote-ref-refs-heads-master

and after that run `brew install nvm`

type inside your terminal `brew install nvm`
wait for it to download


nvm --version 
node -v

lts means long term support (green box, recommended version withou bugs)
nvm install --lts 
nvm use 18 
nvm alias default 18 (defines the default version to be 18)

create a file called .nvmrc and set a node version in there (node version manager)
nvm use will search for .nvmrc and use the version set in there. 


init a nodejs project with npm init -y
